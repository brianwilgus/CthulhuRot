##A Roguelike Cthulhu using rot.js

>I built this for fun using the incredibly powerful rot.js library for javascript as a starting point and to further contribute to my favorite genre of gaming, the incredibly punishing roguelike.  In developing previous games, I have spent a majority of my time working with graphics and this time I wanted to focus purely on the gameplay itself hence the ASCII based interface.  Plus it has that wonderful retro based feel from my BASIC/DOS based youth.


##My goals for this project was to create:

- A Cthulhu themed Roguelike using the web browser
- Random map generation, monsters and combat based on a seed generated hash map
- A game beatable in 20 minutes with some luck and experience
- Discovery based learning.  The simple game tutorials will get you started and the rest is up to you to discover.
- HTML 5 Canvas as my GUI and dyamically drawn to use as much or as little of the desktop that the user chooses.  Later this could easily swap ASCII graphics for a tile based graphica interface with very little work.
- All the features roguelike players expect: line of sight, fog of war, pathfinding ai, dynamic map generation, solvable mazes, inventory and loot system, food/hunger mechanics, multiple levels, character level progression, player stats and most importantly, a way to win.


###Have fun.  Be inspired.  Never stop coding.  Feedback is appreciated.
