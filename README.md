A Roguelike Cthulhu using rot.js


I built this for fun using the incredibly powerful rot.js library for javascript as a starting point and to further contribute to my favorite genre of gaming, the incredibly punishing roguelike.  In developing previous games, I have spent a majority of my time working with graphics and this time I wanted to focus purely on the gameplay itself hence the ASCII based interface.  Plus it has that wonderful retro based feel from my BASIC/DOS based youth.


My goals for this project was to create:

1 - A Cthulhu themed Roguelike using the web browser
2 - Random map generation, monsters and combat based on a seed generated hash map
3 - A game beatable in 20 minutes with some luck and experience
4 - Discovery based learning.  The simple game tutorials will get you started and the rest is up to you to discover.
5 - HTML 5 Canvas as my GUI and dyamically drawn to use as much or as little of the desktop that the user chooses.  Later this could easily swap ASCII graphics for a tile based graphica interface with very little work.
6 - Features users expect with a full roguelike: line of sight, fog of war, pathfinding ai, dynamic map generation, solvable mazes, inventory and loot system, food/hunger mechanics, multiple levels, and most importantly, a way to win.


Have fun.  Be inspired.  Feedback is appreciated.
