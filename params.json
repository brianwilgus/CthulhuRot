In developing previous games, I have spent a majority of my time working with graphics and this time I wanted to focus purely on the gameplay itself hence the ASCII based interface.  Plus it has that wonderful retro based feel from my BASIC/DOS based youth.\r\n\r\n\r\n##My goals for this project was to create:\r\n\r\n- A Cthulhu themed Roguelike using the web browser\r\n- Random map generation, monsters and combat based on a seed generated hash map\r\n- A game beatable in 20 minutes with some luck and experience\r\n- Discovery based learning.  The simple game tutorials will get you started and the rest is up to you to discover.\r\n- HTML 5 Canvas as my GUI and dyamically drawn to use as much or as little of the desktop that the user chooses.  Later this could easily swap ASCII graphics for a tile based graphica interface with very little work.\r\n- All the features roguelike players expect: line of sight, fog of war, pathfinding ai, dynamic map generation, solvable mazes, inventory and loot system, food/hunger mechanics, multiple levels, character level progression, player stats and most importantly, a way to win.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Have fun.  Be inspired.  Never stop coding.  Feedback is appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrian Wilgus\r\ncontact@brianwilgus.com\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
